# sorting-algorithm
  Used Bubble sort algorithm taking input in code of range (marks of students appeared)100 in a data value between 10-90 and searching of element.
Taking a number randomly as random library,with a loop of a length first to end,and using a sorting algorithm which works bby repeatedly stepping through lists that need to be sorted,comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them ,and searching the sorted element in inorder traversalof bineary search tree.
